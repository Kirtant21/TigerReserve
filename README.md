# Tiger Reserve
### CS 341 Data Structure project 2

- Heavliy tested the insertions in O(LOG N) with at least 2000 rendomly generated tiger´s data.
- Heavily tested the remove functionality in O(LOG N) run time, with at least 2000 rendomly generated tiger´s data.

Discription:
Developed a text-based software for keeping the count of tigers’ population in South Asia for a university level class assignment, which is capable of removing dead tigers and also able to search for a tiger from the self-balancing binary search tree data structure.
Keeping the primary focus on time complexity of the program while creating a self-balancing binary search tree.
Tested heavily on adding and removing big amounts of data from the tree.

***Program runs with 0 memory lakes***
